		<h1>About Henry Lebard</h1>
		<div class="about-text">
	        <p>I am avid about conservation, sustainability, and combatting illegal wildlife trade. Community and political collaboration is the way to make improvements in those areas. Maps, spatial analysis, and data visualization are the best depictions of the challenges and geographies we must understand in order to solve these issues.</p>
	        <p>Do you enjoy maps as much as I do, or are you hoping to find your next mapper for a project, big or small?</p>
	        <p>Or perhaps you would simply like to chat about maps, biodiversity conservation, turtles, maps, natural resource conservation, food, maps... maps?</p>
	        <p>Really, whatever your query, I'm here - unless I'm traveling or doing my best to save a few turtles or sharks, or if I've decided to open a food truck.
